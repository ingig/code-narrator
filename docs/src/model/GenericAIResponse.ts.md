## Interface Description

The `GenericAIResponse` interface is designed to provide a standardized structure for AI responses. It contains two properties: `answer` and `requestMessages`. The `answer` property is a string that represents the AI's response, while the `requestMessages` property is an array of `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` objects, which represent the messages sent to the AI system.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `GenericAIResponse` interface:

### Example 1: Creating a GenericAIResponse object

```typescript
import { ChatCompletionRequestMessage } from "openai";
import GenericAIResponse from "./GenericAIResponse";

const response: GenericAIResponse = {
  answer: "Hello, how can I help you?",
  requestMessages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: "You are a helpful assistant.",
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "Hello, I need some help.",
    },
  ],
};
```

### Example 2: Processing a GenericAIResponse object

```typescript
function processResponse(response: GenericAIResponse) {
  console.log("AI's answer:", response.answer);
  console.log("Request messages:");

  response.requestMessages.forEach((message, index) => {
    console.log(`Message ${index + 1}:`, message.content);
  });
}

processResponse(response);
```

## Methods and Properties

### answer

- Type: `string`

The `answer` property is a string that represents the AI's response. It can be any text generated by the AI system based on the input messages.

### requestMessages

- Type: `ChatCompletionRequestMessage[]`

The `requestMessages` property is an array of `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` objects. Each object in the array represents a message sent to the AI system. The `ChatCompletionRequestMessage` type is imported from the "openai" package and has the following properties:

- `role`: A string representing the role of the message sender. It can be either "system", "user", or "assistant".
- `content`: A string containing the content of the message.
