## Class Description

The `DocumentationBuilder` class is responsible for building documentation using various plugins. It imports necessary modules and services, and then iterates through the configured plugins to generate documentation.

## Examples

To use the `DocumentationBuilder` class, you can create an instance and call the `build` method:

```typescript
const documentationBuilder = new DocumentationBuilder();
await documentationBuilder.build();
```

## Methods

### constructor

The constructor initializes the `DocumentationBuilder` instance. It sets the `aiService` and `projectPath` properties.

```typescript
constructor()
```

### build

The `build` method is an asynchronous method that iterates through the configured plugins and generates documentation using each plugin. It checks if the plugin has a default export, and if not, it uses the plugin directly. It also checks if the user has defined any custom configuration and skips the plugin if it's not a user-defined generator.

```typescript
public async build()
```

## Parameters

- `aiService`: An instance of `IGenericAIService`, which is the AI service used for generating documentation.
- `projectPath`: A string representing the project path where the documentation will be generated.

## Technical Concepts

- `IGenericAIService`: An interface that defines the structure of an AI service used for generating documentation.
- `BaseBuilder`: A base class for creating documentation builder plugins.
- `ConfigHelper`: A helper class for managing configuration settings.
- `__dirname`: A global variable in Node.js that contains the directory path of the current module.
