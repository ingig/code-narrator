Provide step-by-step instructions for using the code-narrator library
in my own project by installing the package and running it.

To run code-narrator in cli, you run code-narrator-cli
### cli.js starts ###
{{  cliFile }}
### cli.js ends ###


This is the config file the user needs to create (using code-narrator-cli init) and modify to fit his project,
this will include change to config_file, project_file, entry_file, cli_file and any paths that doesn´t match the user project

###
{{ configFile }}
